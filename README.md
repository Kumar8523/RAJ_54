## Description
This research project transforms traditional paper aircraft design from trial-and-error approaches to systematic engineering methodology. The framework implements computer vision flight tracking, quantitative performance measurement, and enforced single-variable modification protocols. The project includes:

- **Lucidraft Software**: Digital engineering notebook with analytical capabilities
- **Systematic Design Protocol**: Single-variable modification for clear cause-effect relationships
- **Performance Metrics**: Distance, airtime, speed, trajectory, and stability scoring
- **Educational Applications**: Bridge to micro-UAV development and aerospace engineering concepts

The website serves as both a research presentation platform and a distribution channel for the framework materials.
